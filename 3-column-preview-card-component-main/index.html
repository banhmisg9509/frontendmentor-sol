<h2 id="welcome-👋">Welcome! 👋</h2>
<p>Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io">Frontend Mentor</a> challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.</p>
<p><strong>To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>Your challenge is to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.</p>
<p>You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you&#39;ve got something you&#39;d like to practice, feel free to give it a go.</p>
<p>Your users should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>View the optimal layout depending on their device&#39;s screen size</li>
<li>See hover states for interactive elements</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where-to-find-everything">Where to find everything</h2>
<p>Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the <code>/design</code> folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.</p>
<p>The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you&#39;ll need to use your best judgment for styles such as <code>font-size</code>, <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code>.</p>
<p>If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch &amp; Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro">subscribe as a PRO member</a>.</p>
<p>You will find all the required assets in the <code>/images</code> folder. The assets are already optimized.</p>
<p>There is also a <code>style-guide.md</code> file containing the information you&#39;ll need, such as color palette and fonts.</p>
<h2 id="building-your-project">Building your project</h2>
<p>Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize your project as a public repository on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you&#39;re not sure how to do this, <a href="https://try.github.io/">have a read-through of this Try Git resource</a>.</li>
<li>Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.</li>
<li>Look through the designs to start planning out how you&#39;ll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.</li>
<li>Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.</li>
<li>Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as <code>font-family</code> and <code>font-size</code>.</li>
<li>Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you&#39;re happy you&#39;ve completed the area you&#39;re working on.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="create-a-custom-readmemd">Create a custom <code>README.md</code></h2>
<p>We strongly recommend overwriting this <code>README.md</code> with a custom one. We&#39;ve provided a template inside the <a href="./README-template.md"><code>README-template.md</code></a> file in this starter code.</p>
<p>The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom <code>README</code> will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the <code>README-template.md</code> file to <code>README.md</code>. That will make it show up as your repository&#39;s README file.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-your-solution">Submitting your solution</h2>
